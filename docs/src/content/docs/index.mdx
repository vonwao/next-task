## What is next-task?

**next-task** is a minimal task queue system designed for AI coding agents like Codex and Claude Code. Define your tasks in markdown, specify which agent should handle each one, and let the queue runner do the rest.

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Explicit Task Queue" icon="list-format">
		Define tasks with clear IDs, dependencies, and expected artifacts. No ambiguity about what needs to be done.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Multi-Agent Support" icon="rocket">
		Assign tasks to different agents (`@codex`, `@claude`) based on their strengths. Use Codex for speed, Claude for complexity.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Loop Mode (Ralph-style)" icon="sync">
		Run tasks continuously until done with `next loop`. Walk away and let the agents work.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Git-Native" icon="github">
		State lives in files and git history. Each task commit is tracked. Easy to audit, easy to recover.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```markdown
# TASKS.md

### T1: Set up project @codex
**Artifacts:** package.json, tsconfig.json
**Commit:** `chore: initialize project`

Create a TypeScript Node.js project with vitest for testing.

### T2: Implement core types @codex
**Depends:** T1
**Artifacts:** src/types/index.ts
**Commit:** `feat: add core types`

Define TypeScript interfaces for Config, Task, and Result.
```

Then run:

```bash
next loop  # Run all tasks continuously
```

## Philosophy

next-task sits between fully manual coding and fully autonomous agents:

- **More structured than Ralph** — explicit task IDs, dependencies, agent assignments
- **Less overhead than Jira** — just markdown files, no server, no UI
- **Git as memory** — every task completion is a commit, progress persists in files

Perfect for when you want AI agents to do the work, but you want to stay in control of *what* gets built and *in what order*.
